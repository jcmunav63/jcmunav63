## Hello, My name is Juan Carlos! ðŸ‘‹

### Who am I:
I'm an industrial engineer, a university professor, and a future Full-Stack Developer.
I'm currently studying in the full-stack program at Microverse. It demands a full-time commitment, and it's helping me not only to learn web technologies but to communicate and work collaboratively with many people from all over the world.
I have a solid background in engineering, production, and quality assurance, and I've been also involved in different areas like purchasing, planning, sales, customer service, and software development.

### My near future goals:
My main goals for the near future are to learn good skills for web development and also for data analysis.
And I also want to put in practice my skills 
I'm an eager learner but I also share what I learn with the people I work with.
