## Hello, My name is Juan Carlos! ðŸ‘‹

### Who am I
I'm a Mexican Full-Stack Developer and professor.

Some of the web applications I have developed include the use of HTML, CSS, Flexbox, JavaScript, Bootstrap, React, Redux, and Webpack, on the frontend. On the backend I've been using Ruby on Rails, and PostgreSQL. Some of the projects are solo and some of them are team projects, developed with people around the world, as part of the Microverse Full Satck Development program. During this program I've developed some important skills, including hard and soft skills, like remote working, pair-programming, code reviewing, unit-testing, git flow, design interpretation and implementation, responsiveness, accessibility, problem-solving, debugging.

Some of the languages and tools I've learned to use are HTML, CSS, Flexbox, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Ruby, Rails, VS Code, Git, GitHub, linters, Jest, RSpec. 

### My goals
My goals for the near future are to improve my full-stack skills, develop new data analysis skills, and create more awesome solo and team projects.
I want to put into practice my web development skills in a great tech company.
I'd like to share what I've learn with the people I work with or people who start their journey in web development.
